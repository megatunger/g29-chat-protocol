# Security Audit Report: SOCP Implementation

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the SOCP (Secure Overlay Chat Protocol) implementation has identified several critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The analysis focuses on potential backdoors and security weaknesses that deviate from the SOCP v1.3 specification requirements.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing Replay Attack Protection**

**Location**: All message handlers (`handlers/MSG_DIRECT.js`, `handlers/MSG_PUBLIC_CHANNEL.js`, etc.)

**Vulnerability**: The system lacks duplicate message suppression as required by SOCP v1.3 Section 10. The protocol specification mandates that "Each Server MUST keep a short-term seen_ids cache for server-delivered frames (by (ts,from,to,hash(payload))) and drop duplicates."

**Impact**: Attackers can replay messages indefinitely, leading to:
- Message flooding attacks
- DoS conditions
- Potential bypass of rate limiting
- Information disclosure through repeated message processing

**Evidence**: No message deduplication logic found in any handler files. The `AGENTS.md` specification clearly states this requirement, but it's not implemented.

### 2. **CRITICAL: Signature Verification Bypass for New Users**

**Location**: `utilities/signature-utils.js:19-21`

**Vulnerability**: The signature verification function returns `{ valid: true, user: null }` when no signature is provided, effectively bypassing authentication for new users.

```javascript
if (!signature) {
  return { valid: true, user: null };
}
```

**Impact**: 
- New users can bypass authentication entirely
- Attackers can impersonate new users without cryptographic proof
- Violates SOCP requirement for signature verification

### 3. **HIGH: Unvalidated Public Key Storage**

**Location**: `handlers/USER_HELLO.js:45-61`

**Vulnerability**: User public keys are stored without validation of key strength or format. The system accepts any public key provided by users without verifying it meets RSA-4096 requirements.

**Impact**:
- Weak keys could be stored and used
- Potential for key substitution attacks
- Violates SOCP cryptographic requirements

**Evidence**: No key validation found in the upsert operation that stores `data.payload.pubkey` directly.

### 4. **HIGH: Hardcoded Weak Authentication**

**Location**: `routes/auth.js:36`

**Vulnerability**: Authentication uses a hardcoded password "securepass123" instead of proper password hashing.

```javascript
if (password !== "securepass123") {
```

**Impact**:
- Anyone knowing the hardcoded password can access any account
- No protection against password attacks
- Complete authentication bypass

### 5. **MEDIUM: Missing Message Timestamp Validation**

**Location**: All message handlers

**Vulnerability**: No validation of message timestamps to prevent old message replay or future timestamp attacks.

**Impact**:
- Old messages could be replayed
- Clock skew attacks possible
- Reduced effectiveness of any timestamp-based protections

### 6. **MEDIUM: Insecure Public Channel Key Distribution**

**Location**: `handlers/PUBLIC_CHANNEL_KEY_SHARE.js:9`

**Vulnerability**: Uses a hardcoded placeholder key for the public channel instead of proper key generation and distribution.

```javascript
const PUBLIC_CHANNEL_KEY = "shared_public_channel_key_placeholder";
```

**Impact**:
- All users share the same predictable key
- No actual encryption for public channel messages
- Key compromise affects all users

### 7. **MEDIUM: Deterministic Group Key Generation**

**Location**: `frontend/src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx:582-590`

**Vulnerability**: When no group key exists, the system generates a "deterministic key for testing" which is predictable.

**Impact**:
- Predictable keys reduce security
- Testing code in production
- Potential for key prediction attacks

## Missing Security Controls

### 1. **No Input Validation on Cryptographic Parameters**
- Public keys are not validated for proper RSA-4096 format
- No validation of signature format or content
- Missing validation of ciphertext format

### 2. **No Rate Limiting**
- No protection against message flooding
- No limits on connection attempts
- No protection against brute force attacks

### 3. **Insufficient Error Handling**
- Cryptographic errors are often silently ignored
- No proper logging of security events
- Error messages may leak sensitive information

### 4. **Missing Transport Security**
- No validation of WebSocket connection security
- No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Missing certificate validation

## Compliance Issues with SOCP v1.3

1. **Section 10**: Missing duplicate message suppression (REQUIRED)
2. **Section 4**: Potential weak key acceptance (violates RSA-4096 requirement)
3. **Section 9.2**: Insufficient signature verification (bypass for new users)
4. **Section 15.1**: Insecure key storage and validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Implement message deduplication cache** as specified in SOCP Section 10
2. **Remove signature verification bypass** in `signature-utils.js`
3. **Add public key validation** to ensure RSA-4096 compliance
4. **Replace hardcoded authentication** with proper password hashing

### High Priority
1. **Implement proper public channel key management**
2. **Add timestamp validation** to prevent replay attacks
3. **Remove deterministic key generation** from production code
4. **Add comprehensive input validation** for all cryptographic parameters

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement rate limiting** and DoS protection
2. **Add proper error handling** and security logging
3. **Implement transport security** validation
4. **Add comprehensive security testing**

## Conclusion

This SOCP implementation contains multiple critical vulnerabilities that significantly compromise the security of the chat protocol. The most serious issues include missing replay protection, signature verification bypasses, and weak authentication mechanisms. These vulnerabilities could be exploited to bypass security controls, replay messages, and potentially compromise user communications.

The implementation deviates significantly from the SOCP v1.3 specification requirements and should not be considered secure for production use without addressing the identified issues.

## Risk Assessment

- **Overall Risk Level**: **CRITICAL**
- **Confidentiality Impact**: **HIGH** (messages could be intercepted/replayed)
- **Integrity Impact**: **CRITICAL** (authentication bypasses, message replay)
- **Availability Impact**: **HIGH** (DoS through replay attacks)

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy this implementation in production without addressing all critical and high-priority vulnerabilities.
